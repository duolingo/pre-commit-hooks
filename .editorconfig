# TODO: We originally set this value to true, but an isort bug caused it to be
# ignored for several months. We now have a workaround for that bug, but we set
# this value to false in order to preserve existing behavior and avoid diff
# churn unrelated to the bug workaround (which is much higher urgency than
# combine_as_imports). We should set this value back to true the next time we
# upgrade Black, which will probably cause significant diff churn anyway.
