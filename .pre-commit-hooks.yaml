# Nobody should ever use this hook in production. It's just for testing PRs in
# the duolingo/pre-commit-hooks repo more easily without having to tag and push
# temporary images to Docker Hub. Usage: edit a consumer repo's `id: duolingo`
# hook config to instead declare `id: duolingo-dev` and `rev: <PR branch SHA>`,
# then run `pre-commit run duolingo-dev --all-files`
